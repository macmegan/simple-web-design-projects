    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Founded in 2015, Engout is Ryerson University’s group for LGBTQ+ engineering students. <br><br>

Historically, LGBTQ+ individuals have faced significant barriers to equality in academia and experience under-representation in STEM fields. We believe in the importance of providing everyone the opportunity to excel and live authentically.<br><br>

Engout is committed to being an advocate for LGBTQ+ students at Ryerson. We work closely with the Ryerson Engineering Student Society (RESS) to ensure an inclusive engineering community at Ryerson, and host a number of social and professional events aimed at unifying and empower aspiring LGBTQ+ engineers.</p><br>

    <h2>Events</h2>
      <h3>Professional</h3>
      <p>EngOut's Industry Dinner is an annual event that aims to connect industry professionals with students in a safe and inclusive space. The Industry Dinner provides an excellent opportunity for companies to network with prospective interns and upcoming graduates, and for students to learn about their fields from industry professionals. In recent years, up to 80 students and 20 professionals are connected annually at the event. Through our collaboration with Ryerson's Science+, students who attend come from a wide range of in-demand STEM fields, such as all engineering disciplines and computer science. Our Industry Dinner is unique—it is the only student-run event of its kind catered to LGBTQ+ students in STEM with equal representation across all engineering disciplines. This event has seen great success in facilitating meaningful and lasting professional connections between its attendees.<br><br>
      In addition to our annual flagship Industry Dinner, EngOut hosts many events to aid in the professional development of LGBTQ+ students. Since 2017, we have partnered with LinkedIn, RBC, and the Ryerson Career Centre to host resume workshops and interview practice. In 2019, EngOut organised a masterclass and company tour event in partnership with Thomson Reuters.</p>
    
    <h3>Socials</h3>
    <p>EngOut hosts a number of casual events throughout the year. These events have included fall game nights, drag nights, exam destressers, movie nights, fundraisers, and many others. EngOut also marches in the annual Toronto Pride parade alongside other chapters of EngiQueers Canada from universities across Ontario.</p>
    
    <h3>Conferences</h3>
    <p>EngOut maintains its presence in
the national and global LGBTQ+ STEM
community by attending conferences
such as the Conference on Diversity in
Engineering (CDE), oSTEM, Out on Bay,
and VentureOut. These conferences
centre on creating inclusivity within the
engineering profession, and empowering
the professional development of LGBTQ+
students.</p><br><br>
