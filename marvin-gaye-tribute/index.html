    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p class="tribute-info" id="tribute-info">Marvin Gaye was born Marvin Pentz Gay Jr. in Washington, D.C. on April 2, 1939 to Marvin Gay Sr. and Alberta Gay. He is the second oldest of four children; he has two sisters and one brother, in addition to two half-brothers. Growing up, Gaye had a difficult home life as he frequently endured abuse at the hands of his father. Due to his troubled home and personal life, Gaye suffered with depression throughout his childhood, and credits his mother's consolation and encouragement for saving his life in his early years. Gaye also suffered from mental health problems later in his life as he developed a cocaine addiction to cope with the hardships of being on tour, and struggled with suicidality.<br><br>
    Gaye developed a love for singing at an early age; he began singing in church at the age of four, and was encouraged to pursue music professionally following a performance at a school play when he was 11. Gaye rose to fame in the 1960s with the release of iconic hit songs like <i>Ain't No Mountain High Enough</i> and <i>I Heard it Through the Grapevine</i>.</p>

    <p class="tribute-info">In 1971, Gaye released his eleventh studio album, <i>What's Going On</i>. The album was an immediate commercial and critical success, and would later go on to be known as one of the greatest albums of all time. Through the album, Gaye boldly addresses a number of controversial issues, such as drug abuse, poverty, the Vietnam War, and ecological issues. In the backdrop of the Vietnam War and civil unrest in the United States, Gaye tells a story of a Vietnam veteran returning to his home country to witness hatred, suffering, and injustice. With the release of his biggest career hits <i>Midnight Love</i> and <i>Sexual Healing </i> in 1982, Gaye's fame and success continued into the 1980s until his death. <br><br> 
    Gaye tragically died on April 1, 1984 at the age of 44 when he was shot by his father in his family home after intervening in a fight between his parents. <br><br> 
    Marvin had been awarded two Grammys during his lifetime, and posthumously received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and inductions into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Marvin Gaye shaped the sound of Motown and will forever be remembered as a legendary figure in soul music, and a trailblazer for his commentary on controversial political and social issues through his music. <br><br>
